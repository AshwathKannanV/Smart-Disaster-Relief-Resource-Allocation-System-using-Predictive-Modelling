# Smart Disaster Relief Resource Allocation System üöë

An AI-powered solution that predicts disaster severity and optimally allocates relief resources using machine learning and linear programming, with a live dashboard for visualization.

## üß† Features
- Cleaned and structured historical disaster dataset
- Predictive modeling for disaster severity
- Resource allocation using linear programming (PuLP)
- Proportional vs optimized allocation strategy comparison
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard

## üìÅ Folder Structure
- `Preprocessing/`: Clean & load raw disaster data
- `Features/`: Generate engineered features
- `EDA/`: Visual data analysis
- `Models/`: ML model for severity prediction
- `Optimization/`: Resource allocation logic
- `Dashboard/`: Streamlit app

## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AshwathKannanV/Smart-Disaster-Relief-Resource-Allocation-System-using-Predictive-Modelling.git
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ python -m venv venv 
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `virtualenv2`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the App
```bash

streamlit run Dashboard/dashboard_app.py
